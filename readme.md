Knockout is one of the firsts js framework with the reactivity proposal, it implements the observable patterns, components and a lot of other features that is so common today on frameworks like Vue, React and Angular.

I'm learning this framework tha was a milestone for the frontend development.

On this project I'm using:

- Sammy.js: for the dynamic routes
- Knockout.js for the componentzation and reactivity

Let's code it!
